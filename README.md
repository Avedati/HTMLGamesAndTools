# HTML Games And Tools

These are a collection of games and tools written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The games use HTML5 Canvas to render.
The minimal graphics are reflective of my programming level at the time that I wrote these pages.

## Getting Started

Each directory contains one page. To execute the page, open the index.html file in the directory or type this in a terminal:
```
open [Page/index.html]
```
